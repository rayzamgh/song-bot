_DEFAULT_ENTITY_EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE = """You are an AI assistant reading the transcript of a conversation between an AI and a human. Extract all of the proper nouns from the last line of conversation. As a guideline, a proper noun is generally capitalized. You should definitely extract all names and places.

The conversation history is provided just in case of a coreference (e.g. "What do you know about him" where "him" is defined in a previous line) -- ignore items mentioned there that are not in the last line.

Return the output as a single comma-separated list, or NONE if there is nothing of note to return (e.g. the user is just issuing a greeting or having a simple conversation).

EXAMPLE
Conversation history:
Person #1: how's it going today?
AI: "It's going great! How about you?"
Person #1: good! busy working on Langchain. lots to do.
AI: "That sounds like a lot of work! What kind of things are you doing to make Langchain better?"
Last line:
Person #1: i'm trying to improve Langchain's interfaces, the UX, its integrations with various products the user might want ... a lot of stuff.
Output: Langchain
END OF EXAMPLE
